Step01 ---> FDM, staggered, contains only uniform grid solver code, lid driven cavity, channel flow
step02 ---> FVM, staggered, contains only uniform grid solver code, lid driven cavity
step03 ---> FVM, colocated, contains only uniform grid solver code, lid driven cavity
step04 ---> FVM, colocated, contains nonuniform grid solver code, lid driven cavity, channel flow
