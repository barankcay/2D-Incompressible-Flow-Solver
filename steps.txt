step01: First FDM code (staggered uniform mesh, only LDC)
step02: First FVM code (staggered uniform mesh, only LDC)
step03: FVM code (similar to above, but also solves channel flow with velocity inlet, pressure outlet)
step04: FVM code (similar to above, but works on colocated meshes. No stabilization for checkerboard pressure)
step05: FVM code (similar to above, but with stabilization for checkerboard pressure)

step06: FVM code (similar to above, but can use Cartesian, non-uniforms meshes)
